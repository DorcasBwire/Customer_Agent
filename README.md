In today’s fast-paced business environment, delivering efficient and accurate customer support is critical to maintaining customer satisfaction and operational efficiency. This project proposes the development of an advanced customer support automation system that leverages LangGraph, a graph-based workflow framework, and the ChatOpenAI language model to automate the initial stages of customer interactions. The system categorizes queries, analyzes sentiment, and routes them appropriately, either to automated responses for technical, billing, or general inquiries or to human agents for negative sentiment cases. By combining natural language processing (NLP) with a structured workflow, the system aims to reduce response times, improve customer satisfaction, and optimize support team resources. This proposal outlines the project’s objectives, technical approach, implementation details, timeline, and expected outcomes.
       **Project Objectives**
The primary objectives of this project are:
•	Automate Customer Query Handling: Use advanced language models to categorize, analyze, and respond to customer inquiries with high accuracy.
•	Implement Graph-Based Workflows: Utilize LangGraph to create a dynamic workflow that routes queries based on category and sentiment, ensuring efficient handling.
•	Enhance Customer Experience: Reduce response times to under 10 seconds for automated responses and provide consistent, contextually relevant answers.
•	Optimize Human Agent Involvement: Escalate complex or negative sentiment queries to human agents, allowing automation to handle routine tasks.
•	Scalability and Flexibility: Build a system that scales with increasing query volumes and adapts to various industries and inquiry types.


The project will deliver a customer support automation system with the following key components:
•	**Categorization of queries**: Classify customer inquiries into Technical, Billing, or General categories using ChatOpenAI.
•	**Sentiment Analysis**: Analyze the sentiment of queries (Positive, Negative, Neutral) to determine whether escalation to a human agent is needed.
•	**Automated Response Generation**: Provide tailored responses for Technical, Billing, and General queries using predefined prompts and ChatOpenAI.
•	**Escalation Mechanism**: Route queries with negative sentiment to human agents for personalized handling.
•	**Graph-Based Workflow**: Use LangGraph to manage the flow of queries through categorization, sentiment analysis, and response or escalation.
•	**Customer Interface**: A simple interface (API-based) to accept customer queries and deliver responses.
•	**Analytics**: Log query categories, sentiments, and responses for performance monitoring and system improvement.
